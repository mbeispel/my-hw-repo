***Project 1: Earnings Calls***  
This is a cool project! I will say, it is a bit out of the scope of what we focus on in this class. It might be an awesome exercise in web-scraping, scripting, and sentiment analysis, but we don't discuss too much of this in our class. You could do this, though, and rephrase it to model something else, like the next quarter earnings (or some other more concrete output). Also, depending what you want to *model* you may have to do lots of hand labeling. For example, if you built a model on the text that flags filings as Useful or Not-useful or something of that sort, you could, but you would have to go through tons of old filings and do that by hand. Sounds like you've already kind of done this though hah.


***Project 2: Loan Defaults***  
Great project, and solid examples all over the internet. A classic problem to try and solve. Not many up-front notes here.


***Project 3: Citbike***  
Ibid to above. Solid dataset, plenty to play with.
